10-27-2020
- Adjusted trackCB so fit text better
- Few style adjustments

Requirements:
- Basic controls in the audio controller
- Progress indicator on audio controller
- Sliders for both the Bass tuner and Color changer
- Checkboxes for waveform, logarithmic analyser, and track display
- Radio buttons for changing the style of visualizer
- Mood changer cycles through different playlists depending on what is selected
- Frequency data is default view and waveform is a checkbox toggle
- Bass adjuster for audio effect node which is manipulated with a slider

Additional Tasks:
- Logarithmic analyser toggle 

What went right:
- Visualizers work smoothly and look nice
- Not overly complicated/confusing design
- Cohearent design and functionality

What went wrong:
- Logarithmic analyser has a bit of grouping at the lower frequencies due to how obtaining the logs of the audio values works (explained well in the stackoverflow link below)
